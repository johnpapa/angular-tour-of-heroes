# Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo

1. `npm install`

1. Run the TypeScript compiler and watch for changes `npm run tsc`

1. Open 2nd terminal and launch the app in the browser `npm start`

## Notes

- Add redirectTo and/or otherwise routes
- Fix http as it evolves
- Replace mocks with http when ready
- To run in a browser that doesn't support ES6 (like IE11) you need es6 polyfill. Put es6-shim.js  before system.js
