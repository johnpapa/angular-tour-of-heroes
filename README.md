# Getting Started

Super simple Angular app with 1 module and 2 routes. Minor variation of the Tour of Heroes app JP wrote for the Angular docs.

I use this app in my Beginner UI Workshop to help people get more comfortable doing UI in Angular and to show off Kendo UI (the component library). See the workshop details below.

## Get the Code
```
git clone https://github.com/alyssamichelle/angular-tour-of-heroes.git toh
cd toh
npm i
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

## Alyssa's Beginner UI and Angular Workshop
A workshop for UI and Angular beginners alike. Let's pull down the Tour of Heroes app (found throughout the Angular docs) and give it a UI upgrade! All you will need is a laptop and your favorite data set (mine, of course, will be ponies).
 

- Dive into the Tour of Heroes demo application like never before!
- Learn about integrating SASS into your Angular Project.
- Learn how to include a Component Library into your Project. (We will be using Kendo UI but the principles to implement a UI Library are pretty universal.)
- Play around with customizing styles and writing custom CSS from scratch.
- Go over UI/UX principles and implement them on the fly.
- Take part in UI challenges throughout the Workshop and win prizes!

 
### Install Instructions
 
Feel free to clone down my version of The Tour of Heroes: [this repo](https://github.com/alyssamichelle/angular-tour-of-heroes)  It can be found throughout the Angular docs and is a wonderful learning resource. The README has all the instructions you should need. This is my forked version that has the latest Angular version. There will be prizes for best use of a Kendo UI Component and other categories, so make sure you have the repo installed and running!
